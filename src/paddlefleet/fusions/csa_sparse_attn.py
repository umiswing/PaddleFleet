    ``topk_length`` is the exact per-row valid count.

    The kernel's compact (``topk_length`` given) KV-load path is unguarded

    not the trailing bound).

    Compaction is *order-preserving*: valid entries keep their original
    left-to-right order (holes are just removed). Although the backward is
    set-based (dq/softmax are reductions over the key set, dkv scatters by global

    drift in the last bits. Empty rows get ``topk_length == 0`` and hit the
    kernel's empty-row fast path. It must NOT clip to a minimum: clipping to 1

            column index remap instead of the eager elementwise chain.
            Bit-identical either way; wired from the
            ``sparse_attn_global_kv_idx_remap_fusion`` config field. Only the
            "cudnn" backend builds that table, so it is ignored otherwise.
        is_mqa_layer: set by the full-causal MQA caller. Such calls pass their
            own bespoke ``topk_length`` (causal diagonal) that was never run
            through the hole-removing densify, so their padding rows keep a
            ``-1`` at column 0. This flag keeps them out of the ``compacted``
            backward (whose compact KV-load is unguarded against ``mKV[-1]``);
            they take the guarded full-width backward instead. Ignored unless
            backend == "cudnn".
