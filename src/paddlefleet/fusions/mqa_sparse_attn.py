"""Sparse attention over the **absorbed** MQA latent (``d_qk=576`` / ``d_v=512``).

Always uses FlashMLA sparse forward.  The backward is selected by
``mqa_sparse_attn_backward_backend``:

  - ``"cudnn"`` (default): ``paddlefleet.cudnn_ops.csa_sparse_attn_bwd_cudnn``
    (cuDNN DSA).  Fast but ``dkv`` is not run-to-run reproducible (atomics);
    ``test_block_sparse_dsa_gradcheck.py::TestDeterminism`` bounds the drift.
  - ``"tilelang"``: ``paddlefleet.tilelang_ops.attn.mqa_latent_sparse_bwd``
    (deterministic).  ~14x slower on SM100, bitwise stable across runs for
    identical inputs.  That does not depend on ``FLAGS_cudnn_deterministic``:
    it always runs the atomic-free kernel, unlike the symmetric
    ``sparse_mqa_bwd``, which reads that flag to pick one.
SlashMLA instead selects the local CuTeDSL DSA backward
    ``csa_sparse_attn_bwd_cutedsl`` on SM90 (that kerne

The forward cannot be tilelang because ``sparse_mqa_fwd`` asserts
``dim == next_power_of_2(dim)`` and ``d_qk = 576`` is not a power of two.

It is kept as a separate ``PyLayer`` instead of a fourth ``backend`` branch of
``CSASparseAttention`` because the absorbed layout needs three things the 38
production CSA/HCA layers never do, none of which may leak onto that path:

1. **Asymmetric ``d_v``** -- query/key are 576 wide while the value is only the
   leading 512; CSA is symmetric.
2. **Optional sink** -- ``attn_sink=None`` means plain sinkless softmax,
   emulated with a per-head ``-1e30``; CSA always carries a learnable sink and
   ``csa_sparse_attn_utils.prepare_inputs`` unconditionally casts it.
3. **Query-head padding up to the DSA-fixed ``h_q == 64``**, plus (only on the
   ``d_qk != d_v`` kernel branch) a finite-sink LSE correction and an analytic
   ``d_sink``, because the SM100 backward returns an all-zero ``d_sink`` there.

Consumers: the hybrid-MLA non-absorbed MQA layers
(``paddlefleet.transformer.mqa_latent_attention``) and the HySparse block-sparse
gather branch (``paddlefleet.cudnn_ops.block_sparse_mqa_dsa``), which expands
its selected block ids into token columns first.

                       ``d_v`` slice.
        token_indices: ``[b, s, L]`` int, per-batch-local key columns already
                       causal/doc masked (``-1`` = invalid). Must not carry an
                       autograd graph.
        sm_scale:      softmax scale.
        d_v:           value width (the kernel requires ``d_v == 512`` and

        global_kv_idx_remap_fusion: use the fused Triton local->global KV
                       column index remap in the forward and in the ``"cudnn"``
                       backward instead of the eager elementwise chain.

        use_slashmla: select the SM90 CuTeDSL DSA backward used by SlashMLA.
